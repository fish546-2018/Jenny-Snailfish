# Liparidae phylogeny based on RADSeq Data
This repository contains my work from the Bioinformatics class FISH 546 Autumn 2018.  
  

##Project Description
This project will be working with RADSeq data from snailfishes. This data set was generated by Sam Ghods, Ingrid Spies, and Jay Orr in a collaboration between the University of Washington Fish Collection and the Alaska Fisheries Science Center.  
**My goal is to go from the raw RADSeq data to a phylogeny based on that data.**  
###Objectives:
1. Determine number of usable loci for all species
2. Determine if more loci are usable for groups of more closely related species
3. Construct a phylogeny of all species
4. Construct a phylogeny of groups of closely related species that aren't fully resolved on the full tree.
###Project Timeline
Week 3: Organize repository and gain access to data  
Week 4: Have data downloaded, inspected, and trim low quality bases. Install programs needed for further analysis/phylogeny construction.  
Week 5 goals: Become familiar with new programs and begin running basic analyses.
