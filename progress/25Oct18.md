## 10/25/18
As of 10/25/18 I have visualized the data quality using FastQC.

I have set up my desktop computer to run everything so I can use that and have slightly more computing power than my laptop.

Had to run FastQC from the command line not Jupyter notebook (thanks Windows).

Note, running FastQC took a long time (1hr +) because the file is so large. 

I am currently attempting to trim the bases using trim galore.

Once trimmed next steps include stacking reads maybe using Stacks. According to Steven it can be computing intensive (maybe talk to Kerry's lab about how they have run it in the past)
