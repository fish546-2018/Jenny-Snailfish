### Class Notes: Cloud Based Tools
**Galaxy** -> lots of free open source resources on there  
Basically it takes the command line that you know and putting it in dropdown menus.  
It knows whats in your history so you can just select the file and hit execute. It will cue it and then run it and it will be done. Unlike your laptop, you can close your laptop and it will still run. It works for things like `bowie` takes the command line into a GUI in the cloud. Good option if you're not sure how you are going to do it or if the resources on your computer aren't enough.

**Cy Verse** -> huge NSF funded cloud resource, interact with differently than Galaxy    
DNA Subway is like a teaching, classroom friendly tool.    
Discovery Environment is most powerful tool according to Steven. Has option to upload data and then has lots of different apps. They have Stacks! Look into it. Just like Galaxy, taking command line open source tools and making it so you can interface to them, thus you can create your own. You go through the steps, tell it where your fasta is, set parameters, then upload it an it cues. Make sure you know which app you are using. An easy way to run an application, AND IT WORKS ON ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS!!!!  
Has some cool protocols, mapped workflows, CoGe is a good one.
Also a good place to backup data.
